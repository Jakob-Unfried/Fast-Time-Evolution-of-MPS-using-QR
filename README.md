## Fast time evolution of matrix product states using the QR decomposition
Jakob Unfried, Johannes Hauschild and Frank Pollmann

[Phys. Rev. B 107, 155133 – Published 21 April 2023](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.155133)

We propose and benchmark a modified time evolution block decimation (TEBD) algorithm that uses a 
truncation scheme based on the QR decomposition instead of the singular value decomposition (SVD).
The modification reduces the scaling with the dimension of the physical Hilbert space d from $d^3$ 
down to $d^2$. Moreover, the QR decomposition has a lower computational complexity than the SVD and 
allows for highly efficient implementations on GPU hardware. In a benchmark simulation of a global
quench in a quantum clock model, we observe a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude comparing
QR and SVD based updates on an A100 GPU.

## Tenpy implementation

There is also an implementation of the QR-based algorithm in [tenpy](https://github.com/tenpy/tenpy), 
which supports symmetries, but can only run on CPU.

GPU support for tenpy is planned for version 2, and the linear algebra developed at [tenpy/cyten](https://github.com/tenpy/cyten)
